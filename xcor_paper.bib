abstract = {The tightness and universality of the far-infrared (FIR) to radio continuum (RC) correlation is still not completely understood. This correlation is followed by all star-forming galaxies not dominated by an Active Galactic Nucleus, both globally as well as locally within the disks. There is a general consensus that star formation (SF) is the ultimate driver of the relation, in the sense that the bulk of dust emission in the FIR is powered by young stars ending their lives as supernovae which are the main sites of Cosmic Ray (CR) acceleration. Although this simplistic view is correct, it neglects many of the additional parameters that affect the correlation. Thus, a detailed understanding is still missing which is crucial in order to correctly use the RC emission as a tracer of recent SF with the important advantage not to be affected by extinction. Furthermore, a detailed understanding of the correlation will lead to a deeper understanding of dust heating, the interstellar medium (ISM) and propagation of CRs. The capabilities of the SKA are needed to make progress in our understanding of the cor-relation. In particular, they will allow us to (i) extend the study of the correlation to low-luminosity dwarf galaxies which are expected not to follow the correlation so well, (ii) extend the correlation to high-z objects and test whether the correlation is still fulfilled, and (iii) study the properties of CR propagation in galactic halos via changes in the spec-tral index in order to be able to compare the relative relevance of propagation, escape and energy losses.},

abstract = {We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the Frontier Fields to accurately measure the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) in the redshift range {\$}z \backslashsim 6-8{\$}. We combine observations in three lensing clusters A2744, MACS0416, MACS0717 and their associated parallels fields to select high-redshift dropout candidates. We use the latest lensing models to estimate the flux magnification and the effective survey volume in combination with completeness simulations performed in the source plane. We report the detection of 227 galaxy candidates at {\$}z=6-7{\$} and 25 candidates at {\$}z \backslashsim 8{\$}. While the total survey area is about 4 arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} in each parallel field, it drops to about 0.6 to 1 arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} in the cluster core fields because of the strong lensing. We compute the UV luminosity function at {\$}z \backslashsim 7{\$} using the combined galaxy sample and perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the best fit Schechter parameters. We are able to reliably constrain the LF down to an absolute magnitude of {\$}M{\_}{\{}UV{\}}=-15.25{\$}, which corresponds to 0.005{\$}L{\^{}}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}. More importantly, we find that the faint-end slope remains steep down to this magnitude limit with {\$}\backslashalpha=-2.04{\_}{\{}-0.17{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.13{\}}{\$}. Our results confirm the most recent results in deep blank fields but extend the LF measurements more than two magnitudes deeper. The UV LF at {\$}z \backslashsim 8{\$} is not very well constrained below {\$}M{\_}{\{}UV{\}}=-18{\$} due to the small number statistics and incompleteness uncertainties. To assess the contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization we derive the UV luminosity density at {\$}z\backslashsim7{\$} by integrating the UV LF down to an observationally constrained limit of {\$}M{\_}{\{}UV{\}} = -15{\$}. We show that our determination of Log({\$}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}UV{\}}{\$})={\$}26.2\backslashpm0.13{\$} (erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} Hz{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}) can be sufficient to maintain the IGM ionized.},

The BoRG dataset includes {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashsim{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}50 arcmin{\{}{\$}{\}}{\^{}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} of new data and deeper observations of two previous BoRG pointings, from which we present 9 new {\{}{\$}{\}}z{\~{}}8{\{}{\$}{\}} LBG candidates, bringing the total number of BoRG LBGs to 38 with {\{}{\$}{\}}25.5\backslashleqslant m{\_}{\{}J{\}} \backslashleqslant 27.6{\{}{\$}{\}} (AB system). We introduce a new Bayesian formalism for estimating the galaxy luminosity function (LF), which does not require binning (and thus smearing) of the data and includes a likelihood based on the correct binomial distribution as opposed to the often used approximate Poisson distribution. We demonstrate the utility of the new method on a sample of {\{}{\$}{\}}97{\{}{\$}{\}} LBGs that combines the bright BoRG galaxies with the fainter sources published in Bouwens et al. (2012) from the HUDF and ERS programs. We show that the {\{}{\$}{\}}z{\~{}}8{\{}{\$}{\}} LF is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude {\{}{\$}{\}}M{\^{}}\backslashstar = -20.15{\^{}}{\{}+0.29{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.38{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}, a faint-end slope of {\{}{\$}{\}}\alpha= -1.87{\^{}}{\{}+0.26{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.26{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}, and a number density of {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashlog{\_}{\{}10{\}} \phi{\^{}}\backslashstar [\backslashtextrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}] = -3.24{\^{}}{\{}+0.25{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.24{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}.

Our LF analysis is consistent with previously published determinations within 1{\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashsigma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}. We discuss the implication of our study for the physics of reionization. By assuming theoretically motivated priors on the clumping factor and the photon escape fraction we show that the UV LF from galaxy samples down to {\{}{\$}{\}}M=-17.7{\{}{\$}{\}} can ionize only 10-50{\%} of the neutral hydrogen at {\{}{\$}{\}}z{\~{}}8{\{}{\$}{\}}.

abstract = {We report the discovery of 33 Lyman-break galaxy candidates at z {\~{}} 8 detected in Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) pure-parallel survey. The ongoing BoRG survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin2) with Y 098 (or Y 105), J 125, and H 160 band coverage needed to search for z {\~{}} 8 galaxies, about three times the current CANDELS area, and slightly larger than what will be the final CANDELS wide component with Y 105 data (required to select z {\~{}} 8 sources). Our sample of 33 relatively bright Y 098-dropout galaxies have J 125-band magnitudes between 25.5 and 27.4 mag. This is the largest sample of bright (J 125 {\textless}{\~{}} 27.4) z {\~{}} 8 galaxy candidates presented to date. Combining our data set with the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field data set, we constrain the rest-frame ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at z {\~{}} 8 over the widest dynamic range currently available. The combined data sets are well fitted by a Schechter function, i.e., $\backslash$phi (L) = $\backslash$phi {\_}{\{}*{\}} (L/L{\_}{\{}*{\}}){\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$alpha {\}}$\backslash$ e{\^{}}{\{}-(L/L{\_}{\{}*{\}}){\}}, without evidence for an excess of sources at the bright end. At 68{\%} confidence, for h = 0.7 we derive phi* = (4.3+3.5 -2.1) × 10-4 Mpc-3, M * = -20.26+0.29 -0.34, and a very steep faint-end slope $\alpha$ = -1.98+0.23 -0.22. While the best-fit parameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between phi* and M *, our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of the faint-end power-law slope at z {\~{}} 8 compared to the best previous determination at ±0.4. With a future expansion of the BoRG survey, combined with planned ultradeep WFC3/IR observations, it will be possible to further reduce this uncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slope compared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key role played by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

abstract = {We present the first results on the search for very bright (M AB ≈ -21) galaxies at redshift z {\~{}} 8 from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey. BoRG is a Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) pure-parallel survey that is obtaining images on random lines of sight at high Galactic latitudes in four filters (F606W, F098M, F125W, and F160W), with integration times optimized to identify galaxies at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 7.5 as F098M dropouts. We discuss here results from a search area of approximately 130 arcmin2 over 23 BoRG fields, complemented by six other pure-parallel WFC3 fields with similar filters. This new search area is more than two times wider than previous WFC3 observations at z {\~{}} 8. We identify four F098M-dropout candidates with high statistical confidence (detected at greater than 8$\sigma$ confidence in F125W). These sources are among the brightest candidates currently known at z {\~{}} 8 and approximately 10 times brighter than the z = 8.56 galaxy UDFy-38135539. They thus represent ideal targets for spectroscopic follow-up observations and could potentially lead to a redshift record, as our color selection includes objects up to z {\~{}} 9. However, the expected contamination rate of our sample is about 30{\%} higher than typical searches for dropout galaxies in legacy fields, such as the GOODS and HUDF, where deeper data and additional optical filters are available to reject contaminants.

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6 m), cold ({\textless}50 K), infrared (IR)-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next decade into orbit around the second Earth Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-IR camera, a near-IR multiobject spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0.6 {\textless} ; {\textless} 5.0 $\mu$ m, while the mid-IR instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 {\textless} ; {\textless} 29 $\mu$ m. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The key objective of The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The instrument package contains the four science instruments and a fine guidance sensor. The spacecraft provides pointing, orbit maintenance, and communications. The sunshield provides passive thermal control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.},

abstract = {The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Project Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality mirror assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The option of adding an on-axis, coronagraphic instrument would enable imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars. This document presents the final report of the SDT.},

abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, from redshift {\$}z \backslashsim 8{\$} to 1.5. It will image more than 250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on board the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-UV to near-IR. It will also find and measure Type Ia SNe beyond {\$}z {\textgreater} 1.5{\$} and test their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected. Each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer$\backslash$ and other facilities, plus extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies; additional ancillary data are still arriving. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of {\$}10{\^{}}9 M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} out to {\$}z \backslashsim 2{\$}, and down to the knee of the UV luminosity function of galaxies out to {\$}z \backslashsim 8{\$}. The survey covers approximately 800 square arcminutes and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey ({\$}5\backslashsigma{\$} point-source limit {\$}H{\_}{\{}AB{\}} = 27.7{\$} mag) covers {\$}\backslashsim 125{\$} square arcminutes within GOODS-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (EGS, COSMOS, and UDS) and covers the full area to a {\$}5\backslashsigma{\$} point-source limit of {\$}H{\_}{\{}AB{\}} \backslashgtrsim 27.0{\$} mag. Data from the survey are non-proprietary and are expected to be useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the science goals that the CANDELS team is pursuing and the observational requirements derived from them, the selection of the fields and field geometry, and the detailed observing design. The reduction of the Hubble data and planned data releases are described in a separate companion paper (Koekemoer et al. 2011).},

abstract = {We identify 73 z{\~{}}7 and 59 z{\~{}}8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch, and use this large 26-29.4 AB mag sample of galaxies to derive very deep luminosity functions to {\textless}-18 AB mag and the star formation rate density at z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8. The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-Break technique on the full two-year WFC3/IR and ACS data available over the HUDF09 ({\~{}}29.4 AB mag, 5 sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields ({\~{}}29 AB mag, 14 arcmin) and the wider area ERS ({\~{}}27.5 AB mag) {\~{}}40 arcmin**2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just {\~{}}7{\%} in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, AGN, spurious sources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., SNe). From careful modelling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 to {\textless}-18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 and alpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local alpha{\textless}{\~{}}-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z{\~{}}4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05. With such steep slopes (alpha{\textless}{\~{}}-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The star formation rate densities derived from these new z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 luminosity functions are consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find reasonable consistency, with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar mass densities, being only {\~{}}40{\%} higher at z{\textless}7. This suggests that (1) the stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer IRAC photometry are reasonably accurate and (2) that the IMF at very high redshift may not be very different from that at later times.},

We present the first unbiased measurement of the average UV power-law index, {\textless}$\beta${\textgreater}, (f$\lambda$ ∝ $\lambda$$\beta$) for faint galaxies at z ≃ 7, the first meaningful measurements of {\textless}$\beta${\textgreater} at z ≃ 8, and tentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ≃ 9. Utilizing galaxy selection in the new F140W (J140) imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying both colour and power-law estimators of $\beta$, we find {\textless}$\beta${\textgreater} = -2.1 ± 0.2 at z ≃ 7 for galaxies with MUV ≃ -18. This means that the faintest galaxies uncovered at this epoch have, on average, UV colours no more extreme than those displayed by the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. At z ≃ 8 we find a similar value, {\textless}$\beta${\textgreater} = -1.9 ± 0.3. At z ≃ 9, we find {\textless}$\beta${\textgreater} = -1.8 ± 0.6, essentially unchanged from z ≃ 6 to 7 (albeit highly uncertain). Finally, we show that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter in $\beta$ within our new, robust z ≃ 7 galaxy sample. Our results are most easily explained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ≃ solar metallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (≃10-20 per cent) metallicity with modest dust obscuration (AV ≃ 0.1-0.2). This latter interpretation is consistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formation simulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-low metallicity, dust-free galaxies with $\beta$ ≃ -2.5 may not emerge until MUV {\textgreater} -16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {Observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and of high-redshift galaxies at z {\~{}} 6-10 imply that there were just enough photons to maintain the universe in an ionized state at z {\~{}} 5-6, indicating a "photon-starved" end to reionization. The ionizing emissivity must have been larger at earlier times in order to yield the extended reionization history implied by the electron scattering optical depth constraint from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Here we address the possibility that a faint population of galaxies with host halo masses of {\~{}}108-9 M ⊙ dominated the ionizing photon budget at redshifts z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 9, due to their much higher escape fractions. Such faint, early galaxies, would not have formed in ionized regions due to suppression by heating from the UV background, and would therefore not contribute to the ionizing background at z {\textless}{\~{}} 6, after reionization is complete. Our model matches: (1) the low escape fractions observed for high-redshift galaxies, (2) the WMAP constraint of $\tau$es {\~{}} 0.09, (3) the low values for the UVB at z {\textless} 6, and (4) the observed star formation rate density inferred from Lyman break galaxies. A top-heavy initial mass function from Pop III stars is not required in this scenario. We compare our model to recent ones in the literature that were forced to introduce an escape fraction that increases strongly toward high redshift and show that a similar evolution occurs naturally if low-mass galaxies possess high escape fractions.},

abstract = {We present a model for the evolution of the galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) across cosmic time where star formation is linked to the assembly of dark matter halos under the assumption of a mass-dependent, but redshift-independent, efficiency. We introduce a new self-consistent treatment of the halo star formation history, which allows us to make predictions at z {\textgreater} 10 (lookback time ≲500 Myr), when growth is rapid. With a calibration at a single redshift to set the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and no further degrees of freedom, our model captures the evolution of the UV LF over all available observations (0 ≲ z ≲ 10). The significant drop in luminosity density of currently detectable galaxies beyond z ˜ 8 is explained by a shift of star formation toward less massive, fainter galaxies. Assuming that star formation proceeds down to atomic cooling halos, we derive a reionization optical depth $\tau$ ={\{}0.056{\}}-0.010+0.007, fully consistent with the latest Planck measurement, implying that the universe is fully reionized at z={\{}7.84{\}}-0.98+0.65. In addition, our model naturally produces smoothly rising star formation histories for galaxies with L ≲ L* in agreement with observations and hydrodynamical simulations. Before the epoch of reionization at z {\textgreater} 10 we predict the LF to remain well-described by a Schechter function, but with an increasingly steep faint-end slope ($\alpha$ ˜ -3.5 at z ˜ 16). Finally, we construct forecasts for surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and predict that galaxies out to z ˜ 14 will be observed. Galaxies at z {\textgreater} 15 will likely be accessible to JWST and WFIRST only through the assistance of strong lensing magnification.},

abstract = {Understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification and characterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. The 2012 Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard Hubble Space Telescope and, for the first time, systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmic microwave background (CMB) data indicate reionization was underway. The UDF12 campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance, luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forming galaxies. We synthesize the new UDF12 results with the most recent constraints from CMB observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (UV) luminosity densities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depth evolution consistent with the available data. Under reasonable assumptions about the escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing photons and the intergalactic medium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshift z {\~{}} 6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z {\~{}} 7-9 likely must extend in luminosity below the UDF12 limits to absolute UV magnitudes of M UV {\~{}} –13 or fainter. Moreover, low levels of star formation extending to redshifts z {\~{}} 15-25, as suggested by the normal UV colors of z sime 7-8 galaxies and the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by UDF12 to z sime 10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth to electron scattering inferred from CMB observations.},

Since the initial observations of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) in 2003, numerous surveys and programs, including supernovae follow-up, HUDF09, CANDELS, and HUDF12, have contributed additional imaging data across this region. However, these images have never been combined and made available as one complete ultra-deep image dataset. We combine them now with the XDF program. Our new and improved processing techniques provide higher quality reductions of the total dataset. All WFC3/IR and optical ACS data sets have been fully combined and accurately matched, resulting in the deepest imaging ever taken at these wavelengths, ranging from 29.1 to 30.3 AB mag (5$\sigma$ in a 0.''35 diameter aperture) in 9 filters. The combined image therefore reaches to 31.2 AB mag 5$\sigma$ (32.9 at 1$\sigma$) for a flat f $\nu$ source. The gains in the optical for the four filters done in the original ACS HUDF correspond to a typical improvement of 0.15 mag, with gains of 0.25 mag in the deepest areas. Such gains are equivalent to adding {\~{}}130 to {\~{}}240 orbits of ACS data to the HUDF. Improved processing alone results in a typical gain of {\~{}}0.1 mag. Our 5$\sigma$ (optical+near-IR) SExtractor catalogs reveal about 14,140 sources in the full field and about 7121 galaxies in the deepest part of the XDF. .},

  abstract={We study the detectability of the cross-correlation between 21 cm emission from the intergalactic medium and the galaxy distribution during (and before) reionization. We show that first-generation 21 cm experiments, such as the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA), can measure the cross-correlation to a precision of several percent on scales k ~ 0.1 Mpc -1 if combined with a deep galaxy survey detecting all galaxies with m > 10 10 M ☉ over the entire ~800 deg 2 field of view of the MWA. LOFAR can attain even better limits with galaxy surveys covering its ~50 deg 2 field of view. The errors on the cross power spectrum scale with the square root of the overlap volume, so even reasonably modest surveys of several square degrees should yield a positive detection with either instrument. In addition to the obvious scientific value, the cross-correlation has four key advantages over the 21 cm signal alone: (1) its signal-to-noise ratio exceeds that of the 21 cm power spectrum by a factor of several, allowing it to probe smaller spatial scales and perhaps to detect inhomogeneous reionization more efficiently; (2) it allows a cleaner division of the redshift-space distortions (although only if the galaxy redshifts are known precisely); (3) by correlating with the high-redshift galaxy population, the cosmological nature of the 21 cm fluctuations can be determined unambiguously; and (4) the required level of foreground cleaning for the 21 cm signal is vastly reduced.}

  abstract={The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the high-redshift universe, and may be able to test the prediction that the first, chemically pristine (Population III) stars are formed with very high characteristic masses. Since isolated Population III stars are likely to be beyond the reach of JWST , small Population III galaxies may offer the best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars. Here, we present Yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared toward the first galaxies. Using this model, we explore the JWST imaging detection limits for Population III galaxies and investigate to what extent such objects may be identified based on their JWST colors. We predict that JWST should be able to detect Population III galaxies with stellar population masses as low as ~10 5 M ☉ at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 in ultra deep exposures. Over limited redshift intervals, it may also be possible to use color criteria to select Population III galaxy candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. The colors of young Population III galaxies dominated by direct starlight can be used to probe the stellar initial mass function (IMF), but this requires almost complete leakage of ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. The colors of objects dominated by nebular emission show no corresponding IMF sensitivity. We also note that a clean selection of Population III galaxies at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 7-8 can be achieved by adding two JWST /MIRI filters to the JWST /NIRCam filter sets usually discussed in the context of JWST ultra deep fields.}

@article{cooray12,
abstract = {Unresolved anisotropies of the cosmic near-infrared background radiation are expected to have contributions from the earliest galaxies during the epoch of reionization and from faint, dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts. Previous measurements were unable to pinpoint conclusively the dominant origin because they did not sample spatial scales that were sufficiently large to distinguish between these two possibilities. Here we report a measurement of the anisotropy power spectrum from subarcminute to one-degree angular scales, and find the clustering amplitude to be larger than predicted by the models based on the two existing explanations. As the shot-noise level of the power spectrum is consistent with that expected from faint galaxies, a new source population on the sky is not necessary to explain the observations. However, a physical mechanism that increases the clustering amplitude is needed. Motivated by recent results related to the extended stellar light profile in dark-matter haloes, we consider the possibility that the fluctuations originate from intrahalo stars of all galaxies. We find that the measured power spectrum can be explained by an intrahalo light fraction of 0.07 to 0.2 per cent relative to the total luminosity in dark-matter haloes of 10(9) to 10(12) solar masses at redshifts of about 1 to 4.},
