\section{Introduction}

Deep radio and infrared observations are nearing detection of the first stars and galaxies from the cosmic dawn. As such sources form, they are thought to blow out ionized bubbles, eventually merging and reionizing the universe \citep{FurlanettoReview,miguelreview,PritchardLoebReview}. First generation 21\,cm observatories such the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) \citep{tingay13,mwascience} and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) \citep{parsons14,ali15,PoberPAPER64Heating,DannyMultiRedshift} are setting ever tighter limits on redshifted neutral hydrogen emission from the neutral regions between these bubbles, and the now-underway Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) \citep{deboer16} is expected to detect and characterize the EOR power spectrum in the coming years. Ultimately, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will image the EOR over redshift, revealing the hydrogen reionization history of the universe in detail \citep{ska}. 

At the same time, deeper galaxy redshift surveys are beginning to constrain the reionizing sources themselves. Hubble deep field observations \citep{Bouwens2011,Illingworth2013,Dunlop2013} and cluster lensing surveys are finding tens of galaxies at $6<z<10$ down to UV magnitudes of $M_{AB}\sim-17$, and extremely wide surveys are underway aiming to find rare extremely bright ones ones \citep{Schmidt2014,Trenti2011,Bradley2012}. However, current models require the contribution of far fainter galaxies down to $M_{AB}\sim-13$ \citep{Robertson2013,Alvarez2012} in order to agree with optical depth measurements \citep{planck16} from the cosmic microwave background. Deeper observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) \citep{Gardner2006} and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST) \citep{Spergel2013} will be needed to probe this crucial faint population \citep{Atek2015}.

Infrared intensity mapping offers several advantages compared to surveys. Power spectrum analyses can be sensitive to an EOR component even if the signal-to-noise in individual pixels small, and instead of being limited to the brightst galaxies, intensity mapping is sensitive to the cumulative light from \textit{all} sources. Indeed,  ionizing and Lyman-alpha radiation from EOR galaxies at $z\sim6-8$ redshifts into the near infrared, motivating intensity mapping at micron-scale wavelengths. Working around foregrounds is challenging, though. While early studies suggested angular fluctuations in infrared intensity maps traced EOR galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{kash1,kash2,kash3}, \citet{kash4} find that given current constraints on the EOR, this is unlikely. In fact, \citet{cooray12,zemcov14} argue that intrahalo light, consisting of tidally stripped stars dispersed throughout host halos, is the best explanation for the observed fluctuation excess over known galaxy populations. This implies that even after significant foreground masking, EOR foreground emission in wide field infrared surveys is of order $10^4$ times brighter than EOR emission at $\sim10'$ scales.

Given these bright foregrounds, cross correlation with 21\,cm maps may in fact be the \textit{only} way to extract the diffuse EOR component of the near infrared background. The synergy is clear: the galaxies sourcing reionization generate strong Ly-$\alpha$ emission, while the neutral regions between them glow at rest frame 21\,cm. On scales larger than typical ionized bubbles, bright spots in IR maps likely correspond to ionized regions, and thus, 21\,cm dark spots, and vice versa, sourcing an anticorrelation seen in EOR simulations by \citet{StarsAndReionization,silva12,mao14,heneka16}. 

A similar anticorrelation on large scales is found by \citet{lidz09,park14} in simulations of 21\,cm cross correlation with galaxy surveys, but conducting redshift surveys both wide and deep enough to cross correlate with 21\,cm maps is an  challenge due to the wildly different spatial scales probed by 21\,cm experiments and deep galaxy surveys. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, for instance, could fit inside a single resolution element in an MWA map. It may be possible to cross-check the ionization environment of deep JWST sources by comparing the brightness temperature in the 21\,cm map \citep{beardsley15}, but even after order $\sim100$\,hour integrations such detections will be near JWST limiting sensitivities \citet{zackrisson11}.

In contrast, intensity allows similar science with shallower observations, though imperfect radio and infrared foreground subtraction will leak largely uncorrelated power into the cross correlation analysis which must be averaged out over large fields of view. Fortunately the planned Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep{ricker14} and the proposed SPHEREx mission \citep{ScienceWithSpherex,SpherexWhitePaper} would collect all sky near infrared maps, and many ground-based near infrared surveys with few degree fields such as the Dark Energy Survey \citep{des16}, Pan-STARRS \citep{tonry12}, and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) \citep{tonry11} are coming online. In the low frequency radio, the MWA has performed a deep survey of 400 square degrees at high galactic latitude \citep{beardsley16}, and HERA will survey $\sim2000$ square degrees along a zenith strip \citep{dillonmapmaking}. 

With wide and deep IR and low frequency radio surveys happening now and on the horizon, we study in this paper the real world prospects of detecting the cross correlation of diffuse 21cm and Ly-alpha emission from the EOR. We begin in Section 1 with a cross correlation analysis of radio and near infrared catalogs, setting upper limits on the level of foreground correlation, the presence of which would mask the cosmological correlation in sufficiently deep images. We then assess the correlation of faint, unresolved emission through a prototype 21cm/IR correlation analysis between wide band MWA and ATLAS images over a 10 degree field of view. After foreground subtraction and masking, we estimate typical foreground residual levels, and synthesize these with noise predictions into a sensitivity analysis for a larger scale image cross correlation experiment. We also make sensitivity predictions for a cube cross correlation experiment, quantifying the required infrared spectral resolution and taking advantage of avoidance of radio foregrounds using the ``EOR window''.

\section{Power spectrum and correlation conventions}
\label{sec:pspecconventions}

\subsection{Power spectrum definitions}

We define the 3D power spectrum $P(\vec{k})$ of the image cube $I(x,y,z)$ following \citet{ewallwice14} as 
\begin{equation}
	P(\vec{k}) = \frac{\langle|\tilde{I}(\vec{k})|^2\rangle}{V}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{I}(\vec{k})=dV\sum_{\vec{x}}I(\vec{x})e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}},
\end{equation}
$V$ is the survey volume, and $dV$ is the voxel size.

Similarly, over narrow fields of view, the angular power spectrum $C_\ell$ of a (broad band) image $I(\vec{\theta})$ can be shown to be approximately
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Cldef0}
	C(\vec{\ell}) = \frac{\langle|\tilde{I}(\vec{\ell})|^2\rangle}{\Omega} 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{I}(\vec{\ell})=d\Omega\sum_{\vec{\theta}}I(\vec{\theta})e^{i\vec{\ell}\cdot\vec{\theta}},
\end{equation}
$\Omega$ is the survey solid angle, and $d\Omega$ is the pixel size. Thus, we need only evaluate a fourier transform to estimate $C_\ell$ over a narrow field of view. Writing this out in detail, we find\footnote{Note that the normalization of $d\theta^2/N^2$ has been misstated as $1/N^2$ by \citet{zemcov14} (Eqn. 3 of their supplement), $d\theta$ by \citet{cooray12} (Eqn. 1 of their supplement), and $N^2d\ell^2/(2\pi)^2$ by \citet{thacker15} (Eqn. B3). Using Eqn. \ref{eqn:elldef}, the last form can be shown equal $1/d\theta^2$.} 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Cldef}
	C(\ell(a,b))=\left\langle\left|\sum_{m,n}I(m,n)\exp\left(-\frac{2\pi i}{N}  (am+bn)\right)\right|^2\right\rangle\frac{d\theta^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}
where $d\theta=d\theta_x=d\theta_y$ is the pixel size, $N\equiv N_x=N_y$ is number of pixels on a side of a square image, and $\ell=\sqrt{\ell_x^2+\ell_y^2}$, where 
\begin{eqnarray}
\ell_x&=&2\pi a/N d\theta \label{eqn:elldef}\\
\ell_y&=&2\pi b/Nd\theta \label{eqn:elldef2}
\end{eqnarray}

Note that $C_\ell$ has the units of $[I(m,n)^2d\theta^2]$. We will generally work with the dimensionally more intuitive power spectrum $\Delta(\ell)$, given by
\begin{equation}
	\Delta(\ell)=\sqrt{\frac{\ell^2}{2\pi}C(\ell)}
\end{equation}
which has the same units as I because $\ell$ has units of 1/rad. 

The 3D power spectrum is often cylindrically binned to $(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ space where $k_\perp^2\equiv k_x^2+k_y^2$ represents modes perpendicular to the line of sight, and $k_\parallel=k_z$ represents modes along the line of sight. We show in Appendix \ref{sec:pspecrelation}  that this cylindrically binned power spectrum is related to the angular power spectrum of a broad band image (over a narrow field of view) as
\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0)=D_c^2 \Delta D_c C_{\ell(k_\perp)}	
\end{equation}
with $\ell=D_c k_\perp$, where $D_c$ is the comoving line of sight distance to the center of the cube, and $\Delta D_c$ is the comoving depth of the cube.

\subsection{Cross spectrum vs. coherence}

We first extend the definition of the angular power spectrum given in Eqn. \ref{eqn:Cldef0} to the cross spectrum as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Cldefcross}
	C_{A,B}(\vec{\ell}) = \frac{\langle \tilde{I}_A^*(\vec{\ell})\tilde{I}_B(\vec{\ell})\rangle}{\Omega}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ denote the 21\,cm and the IR fields. The cross spectrum is a quantity which ranges between $\pm(C_{A}(\vec{\ell})C_{B}(\vec{\ell}))^{1/2}$ depending on how correlated or anti-correlated the two fields are. 

The cross spectrum is thus often renormalized as  
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Cldefcross}
	c_{A,B}(\vec{\ell}) \equiv \frac{C_{A,B}(\vec{\ell}) }{\sqrt{C_A(\vec{\ell})  C_B(\vec{\ell}) }}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is known as the coherence. The coherence has the advantage of quantifying the percent correlation between the two fields, that is, it is insensitive to a simple rescaling of either field. However, large foreground residuals afflicting either field will substantially bias the coherence towards zero, effectively resulting in large error bars \citep{lidz09,furlanettolidz07}. As such, we use the cross spectrum when we are noise limited, but use the coherence otherwise.

\section{Observations and Imaging}
\subsection{21\,cm Observations}

MWA FHD cube band averaging and uniform weighting

The MWA is a low frequency radio interferometer in Western Australia consisting of 128 phased array tiles, each with $\sim20^\circ$ field of view and steerable in few degree increments with a delay line beamformer. We use MWA low frequency radio observations of a quiet field at (RA,Dec)=($0^\circ$,$-30^\circ$) J2000 recorded over a 30.72\,MHz bandwidth centered at 186\,MHz processed by \citet{beardsley16}, corresponding to $z=$6.0--7.3. They form image cubes are formed by stacking 32 hours of calibrated, naturally weighted image cubes reduced using the Fast Holographic Deconvolution\footnote{https://github.com/EoRImaging/FHD}. The image products include the naturally weighted cubes, the synthesized beam cube, and a model cube generated from deconvolved diffuse and point source emission \citep{beardsley16,PattiCatalog1}. We flag the upper and lower 80\,kHz channels in each of 24 coarse channels across the band, and average the remaining channels in frequency to make a broad band image. 

\subsection{IR Observations}

ATLAS is a 0.5\,m (f/2.0) telescope \citep{tonry11} in Hawaii designed to perform a wide field sky survey for near earth asteroids. The detector is a 10.5k $\times$10.5k CCD array (STA-1600), with a pixel scale of 1.86'', with an overall field of view of $5.5^\circ$. We observe in the I band centered at 807\,nm with full width at half max 150\,nm, corresponding to $z=$5.1--6.3. While this redshift range doesn't exactly match that of our r radio observations, it overlaps sufficiently for our purpose of characterizing the effects of noise foregrounds in 21cm--IR cross correlation experiments.

\end{figure*}


We first ask whether a correlation between resolved low frequency radio and near infrared sources can be seen in our data, and if so, at what level. Given that many infrared sources are AGN, roughly 10\% of which are known to be radio loud, it would not be unexpected to find such a correlation. Indeed, galaxy radio continuum fluxes are known to be correlated with far infrared emission \citep{helou85,dejong85,yun01}, likely due to massive star formation. Such stars emit ionizing radiation which is reprocessed into infrared by dust, and also create HII regions which emit radio synchrotron \citep{xu94}. A secondary radio mechanism is synchrotron radiation from acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in these stars' supernovae. For a 21cm/Ly-alpha correlation experiment we hope the \textit{near} infrared--radio correlation is negligible either intrinsically, or after significant foreground masking and subtraction lest it mask any cosmological correlation.

We study the cross correlation of the MWA radio catalog of \citet{PattiCatalog1} with two different infrared catalogs, both over a 15$^\circ$ field of view centered on (RA,Dec)=($0^\circ$,$-30^\circ$) J2000. The first infrared catalog we consider is from the 3.6\,$\mu$m ALLWISE\footnote{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/} data release of the WISE all sky infrared survey \citep{Wright2010}. We download all sources in our field in the ALLWISE catalog from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/index.html}. The second infrared catalog we use is generated from our own ATLAS observations of this field, using Sextractor\footnote{http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor} \citep{sextractor} for deep source finding in $\sim15$\,min stacks. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:irhists} we plot a histogram of source fluxes in each of these three catalogs limited to our field, and in Fig. \ref{fig:irimages} we show images of these catalogs with 5' resolution after various percentile cuts (0--10 \% top row, 0--90 \% middle row, 0--100 \% bottom row). We choose this resolution to match that of the MWA, far coarser than the order arcsecond resolution of the IR surveys. As such, there are far fewer (1927) MWA sources in our field, than there are ALLWISE sources (46 million) or ATLAS sources (0.16 million). We make these images both to study what level of percentile cut removes most of the stars without exposing slight variation in survey depth across the field. Only the 10--90 \% ALLWISE cut passes both criteria, though all the ATLAS and MWA cuts appear to. (Note that many bright sources ($>0.1$\,Jy) were already removed from the ATLAS catalog out of saturation concerns, and so the 0--100 \% image of this catalog is not corrupted by stars.) Also note that the ATLAS catalog images shown in this figure extend only over a 5$^\circ$ field of view, but in our next analysis we use data from four different 5$^\circ$ fields centered on our main field center.






In Fig. \ref{fig:corgrid} we plot the cross correlation between the radio and IR catalogs. We compute the cross correlation as $r=P_{21,\ir}/\sqrt{P_{21}P_{\ir}}$, where all factors are functions of $\ell$. We use Hann windowed FFTs to compute these cross and auto spectra, and compute the error bars assuming zero cross correlation: $\Delta r(\ell) = [(1+r^2)/2N_\ell]^{1/2}$, where $N_\ell$ is the effective number of $\vec{\ell}$ modes in each $\ell$ bin. Our use of a 2D hann window on the images reduces $N_\ell$ by a factor of 4.

We show the cross correlation as a function of $\ell$ for 0--10 \% (top row), 0--90 \% (middle row), and 0--100 \% (bottom row) percentile cuts of the infrared catalog, with the 0--95 \% percentile cuts of the MWA catalog (black lines). No significant correlation is observed between the ATLAS and MWA catalogs (left column), as many of the error bars pass through zero, and there are roughly equal numbers of negative and positive points. We also print the average correlation values and their uncertainties to confirm this. The ALLWISE cross correlation with the MWA catalog (right column) has smaller error bars because the field of view is roughly a factor of four larger, and in fact we observe a significant (6$\sigma$) positive correlation with the 0--90 \% ALLWISE cut. The correlation vanishes if we don't cut out the top 10 \% of sources, as expected given that these are largely stars, and also vanishes if we cut out the upper 90 \% of either ALLWISE or MWA sources. As a further check that this correlation is real, we plot the correlations after flipping the MWA image (faint red) and observe that all non-detections remain non-detections, and the one detection becomes a non-detection.

\section{Broad band unresolved foregrounds}



% why the MWA?
In this section we perform a wide band power spectrum and foreground analysis on MWA observations. Details on the MWA instrument are given by \citet{tingay13}, but we summarize here some salient facts. The MWA is an ideal instrument for a 21\,cm--IR cross correlation experiment owing to its high surface brightness sensitivity and wide field of view, permitting analysis of many sky fourier modes in a short amount of time, necessary for averaging down foreground residuals in the cross spectrum. The array is comprised of 128 antenna tiles, each with $\sim20\,\text{m}^2$ collecting area over $150-200\,$MHz, spread quasi-randomly over a radius of 1.5\,km to achieve nearly complete $uv$ coverage in wide band images even without rotation synthesis. Each tile is a $4\times4$ phased array of dual-polarization bowtie dipoles summed by a delay-line beamformer, whose output beam is steerable in few degree increments across the sky. 

% observations
SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE THE DATES AND TIMES FOR WHEN THESE DATA WERE COLLECTED
To assess both the level of systematics and noise in the MWA images and their ramifications for our cross correlation analysis, we perform our power spectrum analysis on observations of four different depths: 2\,min, 26\,min, 3\,hr, and 32\,hr. We use data from the MWA's high band study of its ``EOR0'' deep integration field, centered at $(\text{RA}, \text{Dec})=(0,-27^\circ)$. The two shallower observations are zenith pointed at hour angles centered on 00:00, while the two deeper observations synthesize pointed observations at the EOR0 field center observed from hour angles on either side of 00:00. For simplicity and because we are not sensitivity limited, we only use the EW instrumental polarization.

%wide band power spectrum processing (note related to k//=0 bin of the cube power spectrum, see Appendix)
Quality control, calibration, and processing into image cubes in described in detail by \citet{beardsley16}. In brief, the COTTER package \citep{AndreMWARFI}, based on AOFlagger\footnote{http://aoflagger.sourceforge.net} \citep{aoflagger} is used for initial identification and flagging of radio frequency interference, as well as time and frequency averaging to 2\,sec and 80\,kHz. Deeper quality cuts are performed using the delay transform \citep{parsons12b} to identify observations with subtle frequency structure due to wide band RFI or instrumental problems. A per-antenna, per-frequency calibration was performed to a sky model based the deep source catalogs of \citet{PattiCatalog1} and \citet{mwacs}, restricted such that only polynomial amplitudes and phases are allowed to vary between antennas. 

The calibration is a variant of StEFCal \citep{stefcal}, implemented as part of the Fast Holographic Deconvolution\footnote{https://github.com/EoRImaging/FHD} \citep{fhd} software used for imaging. FHD is run in ``first pass'' mode in which no deconvolution is performed, instead naturally weighted dirty images are produced from the measured and modeled visibilities, respectively, as well as a image of the point spread function (ie, fourier transform of the $uvf$ space sampling function). FHD outputs these ``cubes'' in HEALPix format per frequency. Note that this processing is performed in parallel on ``odd'' and ``even'' data cubes whose data are interleaved in time to allow more leverage on estimating the magnitude of the noise and the noise bias.

From here we average the cubes in frequency, rotate them so the EOR0 field center lies at the north pole, and project the pixels into the $xy$ plane, resulting in an orthographic projection to the plane tangent to  $(\text{RA}, \text{Dec})=(0,-27^\circ)$. We apply uniform weighting by dividing by the absolute value of the fourier transform of the point spread function image, then form the inverse variance weighted power spectrum estimate as
\begin{equation}
	C(\ell)=\frac{\sum_{\vec{\ell}}|\tilde{I}_\text{uni}(\vec{\ell})w(\vec{\ell})|^2}{\sum_{\vec{\ell}}|w(\vec{\ell})|^2}
\end{equation}
where $w(\vec{\ell})=\text{FT}[I_\text{PSF}(\theta)](\vec{\ell})$. We estimate the thermal noise power spectrum by computing the power spectrum as above but using the odd minus even difference cube which contains only thermal noise.

\subsection{Correlation analysis}

ATLAS image analysis



We compute the mean in source-free regions, and find a maximum airglow of roughly $5\times10^3$ kJy/sr across all the observations, of order 19 AB mag/arcsec$^2$. This value is consistent with the worst cases observed in the continuum airglow near $1\mu$m by \citet{sullivan12}.

Appendix \ref{sec:Pshot}


\section{Sensitivity analysis}

\subsection{Sensitivity framework}
We adapt the cross spectrum sensitivity results of \citet{lidz09} to our case of measuring the 21\,cm--IR cross spectrum of broadband images with noise and foreground residuals. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sense1}
	\sigma_{21,\IR}^2(\vec{\ell})=\frac{1}{2}[C^2_{21,\IR}(\vec{\ell})+\sigma_{21}(\vec{\ell})\sigma_{\IR}(\vec{\ell})]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sense2}
	\sigma_{21}^2(\vec{\ell})=[C_{21,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})+C_{21,\fg}(\vec{\ell})+C_{21,\therm}(\vec{\ell})]^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sense3}
	\sigma_{\IR}^2(\vec{\ell})=[C_{\IR,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})+C_{\IR,\fg}(\vec{\ell})+C_{\IR,\shot}(\vec{\ell})]^2
\end{equation}
where $\cosmo$ signifies the cosmological component of the signal from the EOR, $\fg$ signifies residual foregrounds, $\therm$ signifies thermal noise in 21\,cm images, and $\shot$ signifies photon shot noise in IR images. 

\subsection{Broad band correlation experiment sensitivity}

Though these are the general forms of these equations, we omit the thermal and photon shot noise contributions in the rest of this section, as we have shown them to be negligible in Sections \ref{sec:pspec21fg} and \ref{sec:pspecIRfg}. We also omit the sample variance terms as they become important only in the SNR $\sim1$ regime. 

Now suppose we evaluate the 2D cross spectrum as in Eqn. \ref{eqn:Cldefcross}, and bin it in annuli such that bin $\ell$ contains containing $N_\ell$ $\ell$ cells. Then the noise decreases as
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{21,\IR}^2(\ell) = \frac{\sigma_{21,\IR}^2(\vec{\ell}) }{N_\ell}
\end{equation}

Then substituting Eqns. \ref{eqn:sense1}-\ref{eqn:sense3} into the above equation and omitting factors of order unity, we find that the signal to noise ratio $\SNR(\ell)$ of the measurement of cross spectrum mode $\ell$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\SNR(\ell) = \sqrt{
		2N_\ell
	\left(\frac{C_{21,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})  }{ C_{21,\fg}(\vec{\ell}) }\right)
	\left(\frac{C_{\IR,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})  }{ C_{\IR,\fg}(\vec{\ell}) }\right)
	}
\end{equation}

Let us optimize the SNR by using only two bins, $\ell_1=\ell_\text{max}/4$ and $\ell_2=3\ell_\text{max}/4$, where $\ell_\text{max}=\pi/d\theta$ and the cell size is given by $d\ell=2\ell_\text{max}/N=2\pi/\theta_\text{FOV}$. Now let's derive some intuition into $N_\ell$ by writing it as $N_\ell=(\ell_\text{max}/d\ell)^2F_\ell=(\theta_\text{FOV}/2d\theta)^2F_\ell$, where $F_\ell$ is an order unity quantity equal to the fraction of all $\vec{\ell}$ cells included in bin $\ell$.

%\begin{equation}
%	\SNR(\ell) = \frac{\theta_\text{FOV}}{2d\theta}  \sqrt{2F_\ell
%	\left(\frac{C_{21,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})  }{ C_{21,\fg}(\vec{\ell}) }\right)
%	\left(\frac{C_{\IR,\cosmo}(\vec{\ell})  }{ C_{\IR,\fg}(\vec{\ell}) }\right)

\section{Power spectrum of photon shot noise}
\label{sec:Pshot}

In Sec. \ref{sec:pspecIRfg} we measure the maximum airglow to be $I_\text{air}=5\times10^3$ kJy/sr, and in this appendix we calculate the power spectrum of this photon shot noise. We must observe that the mean number of photons collected by a pixel during each observation is $\langle N_\text{ph}\rangle=I_\text{air}At_\text{int} \Delta f d\theta^2/hf$, where $A=(0.5\,\text{m})^2$ is the collecting area of ATLAS, $t_\text{int}=30\,$sec, $\Delta f$ and $f$ are the frequency bandwidth and center frequency of I band, and $d\theta$ is the pixel size. The passband has $\Delta\lambda=150\,$nm and $\lambda=800\,$nm. 

The shot noise contribution to the power spectrum is given by
\begin{equation}
C_{\IR, \shot}(\vec{\ell}) = \left\langle\left|\sum_{m,n}I_\shot(m,n)e^{-2\pi i(ma+nb)/N}\right|^2\right\rangle \frac{d\theta^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}
where $I_\shot(m,n)\equiv I(m,n)-\langle I(m,n)\rangle$ denotes the photon shot noise contribution to pixel (m,n), and $N$ is the number of pixels on each side of the square image. Then using the fact that the shot noise is uncorrelated between different pixels, we find
\begin{equation}
C_{\IR, \shot}(\vec{\ell}) = \sum_{m,n}\langle I^2_\shot(m,n)\rangle \frac{d\theta^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}
Note that $I(m,n)=N_\text{ph}(m,n)hf/\Delta f A t_\text{int}d\theta^2$ and $\langle N_\text{ph}^2\rangle = \langle N_\text{ph}\rangle$, so we have
\begin{equation}
C_{\IR, \shot}(\vec{\ell}) = \langle N_\text{ph}\rangle \left(\frac{hf}{\Delta f A t_\text{int}d\theta^2}\right)^2 d\theta^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{\IR, \shot}(\vec{\ell}) =\frac{I_\text{air}h\lambda}{\Delta \lambda A t_\text{int}}
\end{equation}

NOTE THAT $C_\shot$ DECREASES WITH BINNING IN THE CROSS SPECTRUM, BUT NOT IN THE AUTO SPECTRUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

\section{Relation between the power spectrum of image cubes and broadband images}
\label{sec:pspecrelation}

We focus in this paper on the spherical power spectrum of broadband images, $C_\ell$,  instead of that of image cubes, $P(\vec{k})$, as 21\,cm observations have focused on. Here we work out the relation between the two to facilitate comparison with past 21\,cm power spectrum results. In particular, we calculate the scaling factor $B$ relating the purely transverse modes of the power spectrum $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0)$ of a image cube $I(\theta_x,\theta_y,f)$ to the spherical power spectrum of a broad band image $C_\ell$ as
\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0) = B C_{\ell(k_\perp)}
\end{equation}

Using the fourier transform convention discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:pspecconventions}, the left side of the equation is given by
\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0) = \frac{1}{N_\perp^2 N_\parallel dV}\langle|\tilde{I}(k_x,k_y,k_\parallel=0)|^2\rangle
\end{equation}
where $N_\perp\equiv N_x=N_y$ is the number of pixels in each of the two transverse dimensions of the image cube, and $N_\parallel$ is the number of pixels in the line of sight (ie, frequency) dimension. The comoving pixel volume is $dV = (D_c d\theta)^2 (\Delta D_c/N_\parallel)$, where $D_c$ is the line of sight comoving distance from the present day to the center of the cube, and $\Delta D_c$ is the comoving line of sight thickness of the cube. Lastly, recall that $k_\perp$ is related to $k_x$ and $k_y$ as $k_\perp=\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$.

Now substituting the definition of the fourier transform, we find

\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0) =\frac{1}{N_\perp^2 N_\parallel dV}\left\langle\left|dV\sum_{\theta_x,\theta_y,f}I(\theta_x,\theta_y,f)e^{iD_c(k_x\theta_x+k_y\theta_y)}\right|^2\right\rangle
\end{equation}

Simplifying and writing this in terms of the broadband image $I_{\Delta f}(\theta_x,\theta_y)\equiv\frac{1}{N_\parallel}\sum_f  I(\theta_x,\theta_y,f)$, we find

\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0) =(D_c^2 \Delta D_c)
\frac{d\theta^2}{N_\perp^2}\left\langle\left|\sum_{\theta_x,\theta_y}I_{\Delta f}(\theta_x,\theta_y)e^{iD_c(k_x\theta_x+k_y\theta_y)}\right|^2\right\rangle
\end{equation}

Now denote $k_x=a\cdot dk$, $k_y=b\cdot dk$, $\theta_x=m\cdot d\theta$, and $\theta_y=n\cdot d\theta$, where $dk = 1/N_\perp D_c d\theta$. 

\begin{equation}
P(k_\perp(\ell(a,b)),k_\parallel=0) =(D_c^2 \Delta D_c)
\frac{d\theta^2}{N_\perp^2}\left\langle\left|\sum_{m,n}I_{\Delta f}(m,n)e^{2\pi i(am + bn)/N_\perp}\right|^2\right\rangle
\end{equation}

Comparing with Equations \ref{eqn:Cldef}, \ref{eqn:elldef}, and \ref{eqn:elldef2}, we see that $B\equiv P(k_\perp,k_\parallel=0)/ C_{\ell(k_\perp)}=D_c^2 \Delta D_c$ and $\ell=D_c k_\perp$.
